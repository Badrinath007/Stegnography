🔍 **A secure and modern steganography tool that encrypts and hides secret messages inside images without affecting visual quality.**  

---

## 🎯 Project Overview  

This project **enhances data security** by combining **encryption and LSB (Least Significant Bit) steganography**. It features a **user-friendly GUI** built with `customtkinter`, allowing users to securely **embed, encrypt, extract, and decrypt** messages hidden in images.  

✅ **Encrypts secret messages before embedding** 🔐  
✅ **Extracts and decrypts messages from images** 🖼️  
✅ **User-friendly modern interface** 🎨  
✅ **Lossless image quality after data embedding** 📷  
✅ **Supports multiple image formats (PNG, JPEG, BMP)** 🖼️  
✅ **Fast, lightweight, and cross-platform (Windows & Linux)** 🚀

🔧 How It Works?
1️⃣ Hiding Data in an Image
🔹 Select an image (PNG, JPEG, BMP).
🔹 Enter the secret message.
🔹 The message is encrypted and embedded inside the image.
🔹 Save the steganographic image.

2️⃣ Extracting & Decrypting Data
🔹 Load the encoded image.
🔹 Extract the hidden data.
🔹 Decrypt the extracted message.

📌 No one can detect the hidden message visually! 🎭
