## 🎯 Project Overview  

This project **enhances data security** by combining **encryption and LSB (Least Significant Bit) steganography**. It features a **user-friendly GUI** built with `customtkinter`, allowing users to securely **embed, encrypt, extract, and decrypt** messages hidden in images.  

✅ **Encrypts secret messages before embedding** 🔐  
✅ **Extracts and decrypts messages from images** 🖼️  
✅ **User-friendly modern interface** 🎨  
✅ **Lossless image quality after data embedding** 📷  
✅ **Supports multiple image formats (PNG, JPEG, BMP)** 🖼️  
✅ **Fast, lightweight, and cross-platform (Windows & Linux)** 🚀

## 🚀 Installation & Setup  

### 🔹 Step 1: Clone the Repository  
```sh
git clone https://github.com/your-username/SecureDataHiding.git  
cd SecureDataHiding  ```
###🔹 Step 2: Install Dependencies
```sh
pip install pillow cryptography customtkinter numpy  ```
###🔹 Step 3: Run the Application
```sh
python app.py  ```

🔧 How It Works?
1️⃣ Hiding Data in an Image
🔹 Select an image (PNG, JPEG, BMP).
🔹 Enter the secret message.
🔹 The message is encrypted and embedded inside the image.
🔹 Save the steganographic image.

2️⃣ Extracting & Decrypting Data
🔹 Load the encoded image.
🔹 Extract the hidden data.
🔹 Decrypt the extracted message.

📌 No one can detect the hidden message visually! 🎭

🎯 End Users
🔹 Cybersecurity Experts – Secure confidential data transfer.
🔹 Researchers & Students – Learn cryptography & steganography.
🔹 Journalists & Whistleblowers – Ensure private communication.
🔹 Businesses & Enterprises – Hide sensitive corporate data.
🔹 Digital Forensics Analysts – Investigate and analyze hidden messages.

🔮 Future Scope
✨ 🔑 Password-Protected Access – Restrict message extraction to authorized users.
✨ 🧠 AI-Based Steganalysis Resistance – Prevent detection by forensic tools.
✨ 📱 Mobile & Web Version – Develop an online version for broader accessibility.
✨ 🖼️ Advanced Image Processing – Adaptive embedding to increase security.
✨ 🎥 Multi-Media Support – Extend steganography to videos and audio.

📜 Conclusion
This project offers a powerful, secure, and efficient solution for hiding encrypted data inside images without any noticeable distortion. By combining encryption and LSB steganography, it ensures confidentiality, integrity, and ease of use.
